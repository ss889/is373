## Containerization in the Industry

Containerization is widely adopted in the tech industry because it allows applications to run consistently across different environments and makes scaling easier. It helps streamline development, testing, and deployment, especially in cloud-based and microservices architectures. Containers are lightweight, portable, and more resource-efficient than traditional virtual machines.


### Famous Companies Using Containerization:

- **Google**: Pioneered container orchestration with **Kubernetes**.
- **Netflix**: Uses containers to scale its services globally.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Offers container services like **ECS** and **EKS**.
- **Spotify**: Uses containers to deploy microservices.
- **Microsoft**: Uses containers in **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.

These companies leverage containers to improve their operations' agility, efficiency, and scalability.
